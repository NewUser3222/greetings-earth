### 1. `Flower.py`
This is a Python script demonstrating basic object-oriented programming (OOP).  
It defines a `Flower` class with one attribute (`name`) and two methods (`grow()` and `bloom()`).  
Three flower objects are created and their methods are called to show how OOP works in Python.

### 2. `PythonOOP.png`
This image file is a visual aid or reference to support the Flower class code.
